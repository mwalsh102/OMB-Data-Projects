    "# Goal: Using historical data on budget code changes, build out the \"budget history\" for any budget code of our choosing.\n",
    "**Key use case:** Often, we get requests to summarize the funding history of a program, particularly when that program becomes of interest to the mayor, or it is slated to receive new funding. With our current record keeping, finding the funding history of a budget code is \"clunky\" and manual -- you must sort through FMS screens and manually record the data. Often, you can't even copy and paste. This script aims to simplify that process, using a download of budget *changes* to build the history of a particular budget code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal Output**: A dataframe where each row uniquely identifies a Plan and Year (example, FY25 Executive Plan would be one column, FY25 Adopted Plan would be another) and shows us, for each year where the budget code has existed, how much funding was in the budget for that given Plan and Year."
