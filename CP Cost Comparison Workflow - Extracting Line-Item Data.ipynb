    "# Creating a micro-level cost comparison dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "A significant challenge in the review of capital projects, especially in recent years, has been verifying inflation-induced cost escalations. In the absence of good, organized data on historical actual project costs, it is challenging to evaluate the reasonableness of cost escalations. However, if we can compare current project requests to prior, similar projects' budgets -- alongside CPI and PPI data showing inflation rates -- we can ask better questions about why cost escalations are occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below is a replicable script that loops through our team's comprehensive records on capital project budgets, pulls out the cost estimate data, and builds a large, line-item-level dataset of line-item unit costs. It also extracts key metadata about the project, including the date of the project (allowing us to track inflation) and the folder location of the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** While this script does the extraction of budget data, there are many other factors to consider to do a proper cost comparison across projects. Outside of this code, I have written scripts to identify other key metadata about projects, especially regarding the type of scope the project is pursuing and the history of the project (i.e., whether a project request builds upon a prior project request). This is important to consider given that concrete for a pier project may be different from concrete for an upland industrial building project. This code generates the \"barebones\" dataset, while other scripts add more detail to improve and ease analysis."
